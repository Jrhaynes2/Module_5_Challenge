Files for Module 5 homework

I did receive help from the Xpert regarding the section for "# Get the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint." This pointed me in the direction of the "duplicated" function and the method for using != to remove the specific Mouse ID


I was very confused by the wording here:

    # Locate the rows which contain mice on each drug and get the tumor volumes
    
    
    # add subset 

    
    # Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds

I could not figure out what a subset was despite asking the Xpert. I think I acheived the desired result though of calculating the summary statistics for each drug regimen. The ending box plot matched the end result from the starter file.
